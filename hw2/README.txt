- In order to run the main program
	1. change the root variable in main.py to the file path of the folder where CSV files are locates.
	2. make sure that you installed Python3, numpy, statistics, pandas and matplotlib.
	3. run the program with the command "python3 main.py"
- If the CSV file names are different, change them
- For the question 1: The program prints out k principal components as plot and it prints first k principal components as images. Then k values in 
1,10,50,100,500 are presented in a plot which then used to reconstruct the images. 
- For the question 2: The program outputs the coefficients of the linear regression model with the mean squared error value. Also, the plot
show the linear regression plot. The next plot shows the polynomial regression.
- For the question 3: The program outputs the logistic regression with full batch gradient ascent results for different learning rates and 
its performance metrics are printed. This is repeated for both stochastic gradient ascent and mini batch gradient ascent algorithms.
